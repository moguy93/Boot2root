Another very easy way to get logged in a root shell for this VM is simply to use
the recovery mode tool, which can give access to a root shell. First we need to
choose our boot option by halting the normal boot procedure.

With GRUB bootloader installed :
We can show up boot options by holding the escape key at startup until seeing
GRUB menu on the screen. From here, we can select the "Advanced Options" pane,
which will then show us a list of bootable kernels on the boot media. We can
now boot on a kernel ending with (recovery mode), and then select the "root"
which will log us into a root shell. This shell should be used for repair only,
but it is also an available exploit.

Without GRUB :
We can show up boot options by holding the shift key at
startup until being prompted with "boot :".
We can then press the Tab key to ask the shell for boot options (autocompletion).
We can see that live is available. By typing "live" and hitting enter, we get
connected to our root shell.


 This trick just shows us how safe our data is on our computer : not at all.
 Literally anyone may boot as root and get access to everything, or simply
remove the hard drive from the computer and analyze it with another tool,
whatever the native OS is on installed it. The only way to keep data safe is to
keep it encrypted when the computer is not in use. A good solution to do that in
Linux is the LVM (Logical Volume Manager) tool.
